class LocalMag:
    """
    QuakeMigrate extension class for calculating local magnitudes.

    Provides functions for measuring amplitudes of earthquake waveforms and using these
    to calculate local magnitudes.

    Parameters
    ----------
    amp_params : dict
        All keys are optional, including:
        signal_window : float
            Length of S-wave signal window, in addition to the time window associated
            with the marginal_window and traveltime uncertainty. (Default 0 s)
        noise_window : float
            Length of the time window before the P-wave signal window in which to
            measure the noise amplitude. (Default 10 s)
        noise_measure : {"RMS", "STD", "ENV"}
            Method by which to measure the noise amplitude; root-mean-quare, standard
            deviation or average amplitude of the envelope of the signal.
            (Default "RMS")
        loc_method : {"spline", "gaussian", "covariance"}
            Which event location estimate to use. (Default "spline")
        highpass_filter : bool
            Whether to apply a highpass filter to the data before measuring amplitudes.
            (Default False)
        highpass_freq : float
            High-pass filter frequency. Required if highpass_filter is True.
        bandpass_filter : bool
            Whether to apply a band-pass filter before measuring amplitudes.
            (Default: False)
        bandpass_lowcut : float
            Band-pass filter low-cut frequency. Required if bandpass_filter is True.

        filter_corners : int
            Number of corners for the chosen filter. Default: 4.
        prominence_multiplier : float
            To set a prominence filter in the peak-finding algorithm.
            (Default 0. = off).
            NOTE: not recommended for use in combination with a filter; filter
            gain corrections can lead to spurious results. Please see the
            `scipy.signal.find_peaks` documentation for further guidance.
    mag_params : dict

            {"Hutton-Boore", "keir2006", "UK", ...}. Alternatively specify a
            function which returns the attenuation factor at a specified
            (epicentral or hypocentral) distance. (Default "Hutton-Boore")

            in the local magnitude calculation. (Default False)
        trace_filter : regex expression
            Expression by which to select traces to use for the mean_magnitude
            calculation. E.g. '.*H[NE]$'. (Default None)
        station_filter : list of str
            List of stations to exclude from the mean_magnitude calculation.
            E.g. ["KVE", "LIND"]. (Default None)
        dist_filter : float or False
            Whether to only use stations less than a specified (epicentral or
            hypocentral) distance from an event in the mean_magnitude() calculation.
            Distance in kilometres. (Default False)
        pick_filter : bool
            Whether to only use stations where at least one phase was picked by the

        noise_filter : float
            Factor by which to multiply the measured noise amplitude before excluding

    plot_amplitudes : bool, optional
        Plot amplitudes vs. distance plot for each event. (Default True)

    Attributes
    ----------
    amp : :class:`~quakemigrate.signal.local_mag.amplitude.Amplitude` object
        The Amplitude object for this instance of LocalMag. Contains functions
        to measure Wood-Anderson corrected displacement amplitudes for an event.
    mag : :class:`~quakemigrate.signal.local_mag.magnitude.Magnitude` object
        The Magnitude object for this instance of LocalMag. Contains functions to
        calculate magnitudes from Wood-Anderson corrected displacement amplitudes, and
        to combine them into a single magnitude estimate for the event.

        """
        Wrapper function to calculate the local magnitude of an event by first making
        Wood-Anderson corrected displacement amplitude measurements on each trace, then
        calculating magnitudes from these individual measurements, and a
        network-averaged (weighted) mean magnitude estimate and associated uncertainty.

        Additional functionality includes calculating an r^2 fit of the predicted
        amplitude with distance curve to the observed amplitudes, and an associated plot
        of amplitudes vs. distance.
