class Amplitude:
    """
    Part of the QuakeMigrate LocalMag class; measures Wood-Anderson corrected waveform
    amplitudes to be used for local magnitude calculation.

    Simulates the Wood-Anderson waveforms using a user-supplied set of response removal
    parameters, then measures the maximum peak-to-trough amplitude in time windows
    around the P and S phase arrivals. These windows are calculated from the phase pick
    times from the autopicker, if available, or from the modelled pick times. The length
    of the S-wave signal window is calculated according to a user-specified
    `signal_window` parameter.

    The user may optionally specify a filter to apply to the waveforms before amplitudes
    are measured, in order (for example) to reduce the impact of high-amplitude noise
    associated with the oceanic microseisms on the measurement of low-amplitude
    wavetrains associated with microseismic events. Note this will generally result in
    an underestimate of the true earthquake waveform amplitude, even when the filter
    gain is corrected for.

    A measurement of the signal amplitude in a window preceding the P-wave arrival is
    used to characterise the "noise" amplitude. This can be used to filter out null
    observations, and to provide an estimate of the uncertainty on the max amplitude
    measurements contributed by extraneous noise.

    Attributes
    ----------
    signal_window : float
        Length of S-wave signal window, in addition to the time window associated with
        the marginal_window and traveltime uncertainty. (Default 0 s)
    noise_window : float
        Length of the time window before the P-wave signal window in which to measure
        the noise amplitude. (Default 5 s)
    noise_measure : {"RMS", "STD", "ENV"}
        Method by which to measure the noise amplitude; root-mean-quare, standard
        deviation or average amplitude of the envelope of the signal. (Default "RMS")
    loc_method : {"spline", "gaussian", "covariance"}
        Which event location estimate to use. (Default "spline")
    highpass_filter : bool
        Whether to apply a high-pass filter before measuring amplitudes. (Default False)
    highpass_freq : float
        High-pass filter frequency. Required if highpass_filter is True.
    bandpass_filter : bool
        Whether to apply a band-pass filter before measuring amplitudes. (Default False)
    bandpass_lowcut : float
        Band-pass filter low-cut frequency. Required if bandpass_filter is True.
    bandpass_highcut : float
        Band-pass filter high-cut frequency. Required if bandpass_filter is True.
    filter_corners : int
        number of corners for the chosen filter. (Default 4)
    prominence_multiplier : float
        To set a prominence filter in the peak-finding algorithm. (Default 0. = off)
        NOTE: not recommended for use in combination with a filter; filter gain
        corrections can lead to spurious results. Please see the
        `scipy.signal.find_peaks` documentation for further guidance.
