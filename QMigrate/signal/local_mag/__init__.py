The :mod:`QMigrate.local_mag` extension module handles the calculation of
local magnitudes from Wood-Anderson simulated waveforms.

.. warning:: The local_mag modules are an ongoing work in progress. We hope to
continue to extend their functionality, which may result in some API changes. 
If you have comments or suggestions, please contact the QuakeMigrate developers
 at quakemigrate.developers@gmail.com , or submit an issue on GitHub.
