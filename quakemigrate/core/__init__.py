"""
The :mod:`quakemigrate.core` module provides Python bindings for the libraries of
compiled C routines that form the core of QuakeMigrate and do the heavy lifting:

    * :mod:`migratelib` - contains routines for computing the 4-D coalescence function \
    by continuously migrating onset functions through time and space and determining \
    the continuous maximum coalescence amplitude in the 4-D coalescence volume.
    * :mod:`onsetlib` - contains routines for computing various onset functions, \
    including the centred/overlapping STA/LTA, as well as a recursive implementation \
    of the centred STA/LTA.
