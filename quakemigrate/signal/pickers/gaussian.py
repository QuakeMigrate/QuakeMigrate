    This class details the default method of making phase picks shipped with

    station and phase.

    Attributes
    ----------
    phase_picks : dict
            "GAU_P" : array-like
                Numpy array stack of Gaussian pick info (each as a dict)

            "GAU_S" : array-like
                Numpy array stack of Gaussian pick info (each as a dict)
                for S phase
    threshold_method : {"MAD", "percentile"}
        Which method to use to calculate the pick threshold; a percentile of the data
        outside the pick windows (e.g. 0.99 = 99th percentile) or a multiple of the
        Median Absolute Deviation of the signal outside the pick windows. Default uses
        the MAD method.
    percentile_pick_threshold : float, optional
        Picks will only be made if the onset function exceeds this percentile of the
        noise level (amplitude of onset function outside pick windows). (Default: 1.0)
    mad_pick_threshold : float, optional
        Picks will only be made if the onset function exceeds its median value plus this
        multiple of the MAD (calculated from the onset data outside the pick windows).
        (Default: 8)
    plot_picks : bool
        Toggle plotting of phase picks.
