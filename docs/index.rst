QuakeMigrate
============

:mod:`QuakeMigrate` is a Python package for automatic earthquake detection and location using waveform migration and stacking.

QuakeMigrate uses a waveform migration and stacking algorithm to search for coherent seismic phase arrivals across a network of instruments. It produces, from raw data, a catalogue of earthquakes with locations, origin times, phase arrival picks, and local magnitude estimates, as well as well as rigorous estimates of the associated uncertainties.

The source code for the project is hosted on |github|.

This package is written by the QuakeMigrate developers, and is distributed under
the GPLv3 License, Copyright QuakeMigrate developers 2020-2021.
