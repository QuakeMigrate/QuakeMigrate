# Yo!
#
# We aim to keep our git history clean, maintable and easy to access for all
# our contributors. Commit messages are very important, which is why we have
# a commit message policy in place.
# Please use the following guidelines to format your commit messages:
#
#    <type>(<scope>): <subject>
#    <BLANK LINE>
#    <body>
#    <BLANK LINE>
#    <footer>
#
# Please note that:
#  - The HEADER is a single line of max. 50 characters that contains a
#    succinct description of the change. It contains type, an optional
#    scope, and a subject
#      + <type> describes the kind of change that this commit is
#               providing. Allowed types are:
#            * feat (feature)
#            * fix (bug fix)
#            * docs (documentation)
#            * style (formatting, missing semicolons, ...)
#            * refactor
#            * test (when adding missing tests)
#            * chore (maintain)
#      + <scope> can be anything specifying the place of the commit
#                change.
#      + <subject> is a very short description of the change, in
#                  the following format:
#            * imperative, present tense: "change" not
#              "changed"/"changes"
#            * no capitalised first letter
#            * no dot (.) at the end
#  - The BODY should include the motivation for the change and
#    contrast this with previous behaviour and must be phrased
#    in imperative present tense
#  - The FOOTER should contain any information about Breaking
#    Changes and is also the place to refernce GitHub issues
#    that this commit closes
#
# Thank you!
