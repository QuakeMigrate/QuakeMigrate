# QuakeMigrate: Earthquake Onset Detection and Location Method

A python and C software package for detection and location of seismic events using a coherency and coalescence based technique. The advantages over other software packages is the generation of several visual outputs and information. The simple initiation scripts and examples help the user to define parameters for any seismological situation. The modular and open-source nature of the software package allows for the continued development from many institutions and research groups. 

More information on the installation and usage can be found at the [wiki](https://github.com/Ulvetanna/QuakeMigrate/wiki)

## Built With
* [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) - Easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools.
* [ObsPy](https://github.com/obspy/obspy/wiki) - Python framework for processing seismological data
* [scikit-fmm](https://pythonhosted.org/scikit-fmm/) - Python extension module which implements the fast marching method
* [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/) - NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python
* [SciPy](https://www.scipy.org/) - Python-based ecosystem of open-source software for mathematics, science, and engineering
