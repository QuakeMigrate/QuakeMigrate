class Magnitude:
    """
    Part of the QuakeMigrate LocalMag class; calculates local magnitudes from
    Wood-Anderson corrected waveform amplitude measurements.

    Takes waveform amplitude measurements from the LocalMag Amplitude class, and from
    these calculates local magnitude estimates using a local magnitude attenuation
    function. Magnitude corrections for individual stations and channels thereof can be
    applied, if provided.

    Individual estimates are then combined to calculate a network-averaged (weighted)
    mean local magnitude for the event. Also includes the function to measure the
    r-squared statistic assessing the goodness of fit between the predicted amplitude
    with distance from the nework-averaged local magnitude for the event and chosen
    attenuation function, and the observed amplitudes. This, provides a tool to
    distinguish between real microseismic events and artefacts.

    A summary plot illustrating the amplitude observations, their uncertainties, and the
    predicted amplitude with distance for the network-averaged local magnitude (and its
    uncertainties) can optionally be output.

    Attributes
    ----------
    A0 : str or func
        Name of the attenuation function to use. Available options include
        {"Hutton-Boore", "keir2006", "UK", ...}. Alternatively specify a function which
        returns the attenuation factor at a specified (epicentral or hypocentral)
        distance. (Default "Hutton-Boore")
    use_hyp_dist : bool, optional
        Whether to use the hypocentral distance instead of the epicentral distance in
        the local magnitude calculation. (Default False)
    amp_feature : {"S_amp", "P_amp"}
        Which phase amplitude measurement to use to calculate local magnitude.
        (Default "S_amp")
    station_corrections : dict {str : float}
        Dictionary of trace_id : magnitude-correction pairs. (Default None)
    amp_multiplier : float
        Factor by which to multiply all measured amplitudes.
    weighted_mean : bool
        Whether to use a weighted mean to calculate the network-averaged local magnitude
        estimate for the event. (Default False)
    trace_filter : regex expression
        Expression by which to select traces to use for the mean_magnitude calculation.
        E.g. ".*H[NE]$" . (Default None)
    noise_filter : float
        Factor by which to multiply the measured noise amplitude before excluding
        amplitude observations below the noise level.
        (Default 1.)
    station_filter : list of str
        List of stations to exclude from the mean_magnitude calculation.
        E.g. ["KVE", "LIND"]. (Default None)
    dist_filter : float or False
        Whether to only use stations less than a specified (epicentral or hypocentral)
        distance from an event in the mean_magnitude() calculation. Distance in
        kilometres. (Default False)
    pick_filter : bool
        Whether to only use stations where at least one phase was picked by the
        autopicker in the mean_magnitude calculation. (Default False)
    r2_only_used : bool
        Whether to only use amplitude observations which were used for the mean
        magnitude calculation when calculating the r-squared statistic for the goodness
        of fit between the measured and predicted amplitudes. Default: True; False is an
        experimental feature - use with caution.
